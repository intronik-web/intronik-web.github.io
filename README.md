## Overview

Intronik is a user-friendly web hosting service that offers reliable and free web hosting solutions. With a focus on simplicity and ease of use, Intronik allows users to manage their websites using a straightforward `config.json` file.

## Pricing

The price for using Intronik's web hosting service is calculated using the following formula:


$f(x) = (x^2 - x^2) \cdot e^x$


Where:
- \( x \) is any real number.

To break it down:
- \( x^2 - x^2 \) simplifies to 0.
- Therefore, the equation becomes \( 0 \cdot e^x \), which equals 0.

4. **Render Your Website**: Use the following URL format to render your website:
   ```
   https://intronik-web.github.io/render?config=https://url.to/your/config.json
